**In Scope for FY2026**

- **Redefine and redesign the existing Commercial Banking Developer Experience**  
  Review the current Institutional API experience (hosted under **developer.bmo.com**) to simplify and improve usability across all stages — discovery, evaluation, onboarding, and production access.

- **Enhance existing API experiences (Payments and Account Information)**  
  Focus on optimizing the overall user journey and interface design for the APIs already released in FY2025, including Payments and Account Information APIs.  
  *No new APIs will be introduced as part of this redesign.*

- **Unify the developer workflow end-to-end**  
  Evaluate and refine how developers, Sales, Implementation, and Support teams interact across the onboarding and consent lifecycle.  
  Align flows, terminology, and touchpoints to create a cohesive, predictable experience.

- **Improve consent, registration, and sandbox interactions**  
  These features already exist but will be enhanced for clarity and consistency across different personas (developer, tech lead, PCA, and internal support roles).

- **Document and align with connected initiatives**  
  The creation of a **new integrated homepage** (a unified developer entry point under developer.bmo.com) is a **related but separate initiative**.  
  This program will reference that work where applicable and link to its Confluence page once available, but it is **not within this project’s delivery scope**.

- **Establish the 2026 design foundation**  
  Produce updated design specifications, component patterns, and journey documentation that will serve as the reference model for future API experience enhancements across Commercial Banking.
