## Phase 1 — Discover

### Current Experience
The current discovery experience is largely information-driven and depends on sales-assisted navigation.  
Clients or IT teams arrive at the BMO Developer Portal to understand whether APIs meet their business needs.  
Today, the process looks like this:

1. Clients or IT leads land on the Developer Portal (often via referral or search) and browse general API information.  
2. Developer or IT teams review existing documentation to assess feasibility and fit with internal systems.  
3. Clients may also visit the OLBB Marketplace to explore API cards or contact Sales for further details.  
4. Sales representatives respond manually with documentation links, API details, and follow-up calls.  
5. The overall journey is product-centric rather than solution-centric — clients browse “what APIs exist” instead of “how can I automate this workflow.”

### Proposed Enhancements
The redesigned **Discover** phase will shift from product listings to **solution-oriented discovery**.  
The focus is to help commercial clients identify use-cases quickly, build trust, and explore APIs through guided context.

1. **Solutions Gallery (Public)**  
   Curated business-oriented entry points (e.g., *Embedded Payments*, *Cash Visibility*, *ERP Connectors*, *Compliance*).  
   Developers start with their *goal*, not the API name.

2. **API Catalog (Public)**  
   A unified catalog filterable by product, region, auth type, and maturity (GA / Pilot).  
   Replaces legacy spreadsheet or static API list formats.  
   🔗 Reference: [Plaid API Resources Catalog](https://plaid.com/docs/resources/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

3. **“Why BMO” / Commercial API Story**  
   A trust-building section highlighting bank-grade security, compliance, reliability, and innovation tailored for commercial clients.

4. **Smart Search / AI Discovery**  
   Intent-based search enabling natural-language queries (e.g., *“automate payables”*, *“reconcile transactions”*).  
   Helps developers find APIs by purpose instead of guessing endpoint names.
