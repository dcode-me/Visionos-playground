## User Journey Phases

The BMO Developer Experience is structured around five key user journey phases.  
Each phase page captures the **current experience**, **proposed enhancements**, and eventually the **approved FY2026 scope**, including design references, mockups, and linked decisions.

**Journey Phases**

1. [[Phase 1 — Discover]]  
   Identify how clients and developers find BMO’s APIs and learn about available capabilities.

2. [[Phase 2 — Evaluate]]  
   Understand the process developers follow to assess APIs, environments, and authentication.

3. [[Phase 3 — Learn (Onboarding & Integration Planning)]]  
   Review onboarding flow, tutorials, and consent setup.

4. [[Phase 4 — Build (Integration & Consent)]]  
   Track how developers implement and integrate APIs with sandbox and production environments.

5. [[Phase 5 — Operate & Scale]]  
   Manage API usage, monitoring, and post-launch analytics for enterprise clients.
