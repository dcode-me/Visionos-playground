## Phase 3 â€” Learn (Onboarding & Integration Planning)

### Current Experience
The current onboarding process is functional but manual, with multiple hand-offs between Sales, Implementation, and Technical teams.  
Most steps happen outside the portal, relying on forms, calls, and emails.

1. The Primary Customer Admin (PCA) or client contact logs into OLBB and submits a production enrollment form (including pricing and setup details).  
2. The Sales team schedules onboarding calls, confirms pricing, and initiates the implementation request.  
3. A Solution Delivery Consultant (SDC) reviews the form, verifies details, and creates an onboarding ticket.  
4. Documentation and Legal teams prepare contracts and service documentation manually.  
5. Once approved, the SDC enrolls the client, generates credentials (Client ID, API Key, Secret), and shares them securely by email.

### Proposed Enhancements
The redesigned **Learn** phase focuses on **guided, in-portal onboarding**, reducing manual touchpoints and improving transparency for both developers and PCAs.

1. **Guided Tutorials & Quick-Start Journeys**  
   Step-by-step, use-case-based guides (e.g., *Create first payment*, *Check account balance*, *Subscribe to status webhook*).  
   Encourages self-learning and reduces dependency on Sales or Implementation.

2. **Unified Consent UX Module**  
   System automatically retrieves requested + existing consents, filters by entitlement, and displays toggle-based Modify / Revoke / Continue flow.  
   Simplifies the experience for PCAs managing multiple accounts.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Plaid Consent UX Example](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/#link-token-create)  

3. **Interactive API Sandbox (Scenario Data)**  
   Developers can test both success and failure cases (e.g., insufficient funds, missing entitlement) directly within the portal.  
   Reduces the need for separate Postman environments.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Adyen API Explorer](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/)  

4. **Security & Compliance Guides**  
   Embedded best-practice docs for token storage, logging, and PCI-compliant integrations.  
   Reduces back-and-forth with InfoSec reviews.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [AWS Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/security-best-practices/)  

5. **Integration Checklist Generator + Credential Automation**  
   Auto-generates an onboarding readiness PDF (logging, retries, webhook verification) and delivers credentials securely through the portal dashboard â€” no more emailed secrets.
