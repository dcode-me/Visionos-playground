**Scope Overview**

The current program focuses on defining, planning, and implementing the **Commercial Banking API experience** — specifically the developer journey, tooling, and processes associated with **Institutional APIs**.

---

### 1. Commercial Banking APIs

The Commercial Banking API ecosystem is divided into two main categories:

**a. Institutional (Organizational) APIs — _In Scope_**  
• Core focus of this program.  
• Enables direct API connectivity for institutional clients and enterprise developers.  
• Covers full API lifecycle: discovery, registration, consent, sandbox, production onboarding, and monitoring.  
• Responsible teams: Commercial API Product, UX, Engineering, and Platform Delivery.

**b. Pre-Built Integrations — _Reference Only_**  
• APIs and integrations exposed via third-party platforms such as **FISPAN**, **Xero**, **NetSuite**, **Oracle**, and **QuickBooks**.  
• These integrations leverage BMO data and services but are managed through third-party partner ecosystems.  
• Not part of current design or delivery scope; mentioned only for contextual completeness.

The **U.S. Open Banking API** ecosystem is managed independently by other BMO business lines. It will eventually connect to the unified developer homepage but is not part of the current design or implementation scope.

**Structure:**
- **BMO Digital Banking APIs** — Focused on retail digital banking and consumer banking integrations.  
- **BMO Alto APIs** — Operated by the **BMO Alto** subsidiary, aligned with the U.S. Retail Banking organization.  

These APIs will maintain their own landing pages and experiences, managed by their respective business units.
