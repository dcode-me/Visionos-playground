## Phase 2 — Evaluate

### Current Experience
The current evaluation process focuses on technical feasibility but requires multiple hand-offs between client teams and BMO representatives.  
The experience today is functional but fragmented, with limited interactivity inside the portal itself.

1. The client’s IT team gains access to a secure Developer Portal environment to review API documentation and data models.  
2. They manually download specifications or Postman collections to evaluate API fit.  
3. Sandbox access and environment requests are handled via forms or direct emails.  
4. Teams conduct internal feasibility analysis before submitting production upgrade requests through the Marketplace or Sales.  
5. BMO Sales or Product teams manually coordinate follow-up sessions and pre-production enablement.

### Proposed Enhancements
The redesigned **Evaluate** phase aims to make evaluation faster, self-service, and developer-friendly — replacing manual steps with interactive documentation and a clearer sandbox path.

1. **API Reference MFE (Modular Frontend Experience)**  
   Three-panel documentation layout: navigation, content, and interactive “Try It” console.  
   Supports real-time code samples, curl commands, and live responses.  
   🔗 Reference: [Stripe API Reference](https://stripe.com/docs/api) · [Twilio API Explorer](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api)  

2. **Auth & Environments Hub**  
   Centralized visualization of Sandbox → Pre-Prod → Prod environments with scope and token details.  
   Enables self-serve token generation and simplified environment switching.  
   🔗 Reference: [Plaid API Environments](https://plaid.com/docs/api/#environments)  

3. **Download Center**  
   One location for all OpenAPI specs, Postman collections, SDKs, and sample apps.  
   Encourages quick evaluation without file-hunting or version confusion.  
   🔗 Reference: [Adyen Developer Docs – Downloads](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-libraries)  

4. **Commercial FAQ & Consent Guide**  
   Dedicated section explaining PCA-level consent, entitlements, and common security questions.  
   Reduces dependency on ad-hoc sales or support clarifications.  
   🔗 Reference: [Plaid Security & Compliance](https://plaid.com/security/)  

5. **Pre-Production Request Flow**  
   Converts current manual email process into an automated portal request, enabling one-click upgrade when sandbox testing is complete.
