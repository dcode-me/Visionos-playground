## Phase 5 â€” Operate & Scale

### Current Experience
Once integration is complete and production access is granted, most client operations move outside the portal.  
Monitoring, billing, and support processes are handled through separate systems, making visibility and control limited.

1. PCAs authorize API access for selected accounts via OLBB.  
2. Applications receive redirect URLs, configure authentication, and begin calling production APIs.  
3. Billing details (setup and implementation fees) are handled manually through Sales and XAA billing system.  
4. Support requests are logged through email or internal CRM rather than the Developer Portal.  
5. There is limited visibility for clients into usage, performance, or consent management after go-live.

### Proposed Enhancements
The redesigned **Operate & Scale** phase aims to transform the portal into a true operational dashboard â€” where clients can monitor usage, manage access, and receive updates without leaving the ecosystem.

1. **Org Workspace Dashboard**  
   Unified administrative view listing all apps, API keys, connected accounts, and environments.  
   Supports role-based access and visual consent history.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Google Cloud Console â€“ Project Overview](https://console.cloud.google.com/)  

2. **Usage & Analytics Module**  
   Real-time analytics showing API call volumes, latency, error rates, and user behavior patterns.  
   Helps both clients and BMO teams identify issues proactively.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Azure API Management Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/howto-use-analytics)  

3. **Partner / ERP Connector Hub**  
   Central hub for plug-and-play integrations (FISPAN, SAP, NetSuite, QuickBooks).  
   Simplifies third-party connectivity without custom builds.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Salesforce AppExchange Connectors](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/)  

4. **Changelog & Announcements Center**  
   Dynamic feed of version updates, deprecations, and new feature launches.  
   Clients can subscribe via RSS or email.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [Stripe Changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/changelog)  

5. **Billing & Support Integration**  
   Automated billing view with usage-based cost tracking and SLA-linked support ticketing.  
   Offers clear visibility into consumption and escalation paths.  
   ðŸ”— Reference: [AWS Billing Dashboard](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/)
